## About Scrimba

This site was built alongside the "Learn HTML and CSS" course on Scrimba, an interactive learning platform that blends video tutorials with hands-on coding. Scrimba's unique screencast format made it easy to learn and put my new knowledge to the test.

I hope you like this site and if you have any questions about Glenview, click on my face on the card at the bottom of this site 😁
